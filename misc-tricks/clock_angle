 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_angle_problem
 A method to solve such problems is to consider the rate of change of the angle in degrees per minute.
 The hour hand of a normal 12-hour analogue clock turns 360째 in 12 hours (720 minutes) or 0.5째 per minute.
 HOUR:  0.5 x (H x 60 + M)
 The minute hand rotates through 360째 in 60 minutes or 6째 per minute.
 MINUTE: 6 x M

 When will HOUR / MINUTE superimposed?
 0.5 x (H x 60 + M) = 6 x M, where H = [0,11]
